This draft is a great start, but there are a few structural issues and policy conflicts we need to clean up.

Specifically, you accidentally have **two Section 5s**, some duplicated paragraphs, and the formatting for the Google Limited Use policy got a bit scrambled. Most importantly, we need to add a strict "carve-out" to your Marketing Partners clause so Google reviewers don't think you are selling their Calendar data!

I have completely reformatted, cleaned up, and bulletproofed your Privacy Policy to meet the strict requirements of the Google Cloud API Review, Apple App Store (Guideline 5.1.1), and Google Play Store.
