# Content Moderation Policy

**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026

## 1. Overview
VIMciety is committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and positive community. To ensure this, we enforce a strict **Zero Tolerance Policy** against objectionable content and abusive behavior. This policy outlines the mechanisms we provide to users to report violations and how we enforce our standards.

## 2. Prohibited Content
Users may not post, upload, or share content that includes:
* **Hate Speech:** Attacks based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation.
* **Harassment & Bullying:** Targeted attacks, threats, or intimidation.
* **Nudity & Pornography:** Explicit sexual content.
* **Violence:** Graphic depictions of violence or promotion of illegal acts.
* **Self-Harm:** Promotion or encouragement of self-injury or suicide.

## 3. User Safety Tools
We empower our community to maintain safety through the following in-app features:

### **A. Reporting Content**
* **How to Report:** Every post on VIMciety includes a "Report" button (located next to the post actions).
* **Process:** When a user taps "Report," they are prompted to select a reason (e.g., Harassment, Spam). This report is immediately sent to our safety team for review.
* **Anonymity:** All reports are anonymous. The author of the reported content is not notified of who reported them.

### **B. Blocking Users**
* **How to Block:** Users can visit any profile and tap the "Block User" button.
* **Effect:** Blocking a user immediately hides all their content from your feed and prevents them from interacting with you. This action is reversible by you at any time.

## 4. Enforcement & Review Process

### **A. Review Timeframe**
Our moderation team monitors the report queue daily. We are committed to reviewing and acting on reported content within **24 hours** of submission.

### **B. Actions We Take**
Upon review, if content is found to violate our policy, we take one or more of the following actions:
1.  **Removal:** The offending content is permanently deleted from the platform.
2.  **Suspension:** The user's account may be temporarily suspended.
3.  **Termination:** Serious or repeat violations will result in a permanent ban.

### **C. Appeals**
If you believe your content was removed in error, you may contact us at **[help@vimciety.com]**.

## 5. Community Guidelines
By using VIMciety, you agree to treat all users with dignity and respect. We reserve the right to remove any content that we believe harms the integrity of our community, even if it does not explicitly violate the categories listed above.
